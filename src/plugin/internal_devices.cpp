// Realtime rules are the same as every other backend: everything the audio
// thread touches is a fixed-size member allocated (or rather, sized) at
// construction. prepare() only recomputes coefficients; process() and midi()

// Parameters are plain float stores. The GUI writes them while the audio thread
// reads them, exactly as documented on PluginInstance::setParam: a 4-byte
// aligned float cannot tear on any target we build for, and a stale read costs
// at most one block of latency.

//   * instantiateInternal, below, accepts either spelling directly, so a
//     PluginDesc that came from an old project file (rather than from the
//     registry) still loads.
//
// Loading an old set and re-saving it therefore rewrites `lattice:pulse` to
// `nxtakt:pulse` -- the descriptor won, as it must, since the registry only

// at drive = 0 the factor is 1 and the device is exactly tanh(x) (unity for
// small signals), and at large drive it tends to tanh(a0) = 0.462, i.e. the
// hard-clipped square is pulled back to the reference level instead of running

// --- EQ Three --------------------------------------------------------------
// Low shelf, peaking mid, high shelf. RBJ cookbook sections, transposed direct
// form II, per-channel state.
//
// Three decisions worth stating:
//
//   * Coefficients are recomputed when a parameter MOVES, not per sample and
//     not per block: a cos, a sin and a sqrt per section is far too much to pay
//     48000 times a second for a knob nobody is touching. The cached values are
//     compared verbatim, so a static EQ costs three multiply chains and nothing
//     else.
//   * The resulting coefficient step is glided per sample over ~10 ms. Without
//     it, sweeping the mid frequency steps the whole section once per block and
//     you hear the block rate. Interpolating direct-form coefficients is only
//     safe for sections that stay well inside the stability triangle, which
//     these do: |a2| < 1 for every RBJ shelf/peak below Nyquist, and the
//     frequency is clamped to 0.495*sr before the trigonometry so a project
//     opened at 32 kHz cannot ask for a section at 18 kHz.
//   * TDF-II rather than DF-I because its state stays on the order of the
//     signal rather than of the filter's internal gain, which is what keeps a
//     +15 dB shelf from parking large numbers in memory between blocks.
//
// Defaults are flat: 0 dB on all three bands is bit-for-bit unity through the
// biquads (b0 = 1, everything else 0), so adding the device to a chain and
// playing changes nothing at all until a knob moves. That is the correct
// behaviour for the one device that ends up on every channel.

// an RMS window with a musically useful time constant simply does not see it.
// An RMS mode would be a second detector and a mode switch, and the honest
// version of that device is a separate one (a bus/glue compressor) rather than
// a switch on this one.
//
// Stereo-linked: the detector sees max(|L|, |R|) and ONE gain is applied to
// both channels. Independent per-channel gains on a stereo bus pull the image
// towards whichever side is quieter every time a snare lands -- that is not a
// subtlety, it is the difference between a mix compressor and a broken one.
//
// Log-domain smoothing: the attack/release one-pole runs on the gain reduction
// in dB, not on the linear envelope. Two things follow. The attack time means
// the same thing whatever the ratio (a 10 ms attack reaches 63% of ITS OWN
// target GR in 10 ms, whether that target is 3 dB or 30), and the release is a
// constant number of dB per second rather than an exponential in linear gain,
// which is what "release" means to everyone who has ever used one.
//
// Defaults: -18 dB threshold, 3:1, 10 ms / 120 ms, 6 dB knee, no makeup. A

// device on a channel and playing is inaudible until the material asks for it.

//
// THE TEMPO SITUATION, in full, because it is the one thing here that is not
// self-contained:
//
// PluginInstance (host.h) carries audio, MIDI, parameters and latency. It does
// NOT carry transport: there is no tempo, no beat position and no time
// signature on the contract, and the engine's process loop calls
// fx->process(bufs, bufs, 2, n) with nothing else. The engine has the tempo
// (Engine::tempo_, and the atomic it publishes for the GUI), but src/plugin
// deliberately does not depend on src/audio, and the plugin layer lives in the
// daemon process where reaching for a UI-side session struct would be a lie
// anyway.
//
// So sync is implemented in full -- the division table, the beats-to-samples
// conversion, the switch. The source of the number is layered: host.h now
// carries setTransport(bpm, beat, playing), the engine pushes it before every
// chain's process(), and this device PREFERS the pushed tempo whenever it has
// seen one. The Tempo parameter remains as the fallback for hosts that never
// push (offline tools, standalone tests) -- and it must remain in the list
// regardless, because internal ids are indices and removing it would shift
// every id after it, silently mis-restoring any set saved before the removal.
//
// Still open: LV2/CLAP forwarding (LV2: a time:Position atom on the event
// input; CLAP: clap_event_transport_t in the process struct -- both formats
// already have a place for it). Third-party plugins do not see the transport
// yet; internal devices and racks do. The division maths, which is the part
// that can be wrong, is written and tested independently of the source.
//
// Feedback path: the delayed signal is lowpassed BEFORE it re-enters the line
// and not on the way out, so each repeat is one filter pass darker than the
// last -- the tape/BBD behaviour every musician expects -- while the first
// repeat is exactly what went in.
//
// Ping-pong sums the input to mono and injects it into the left line only; left
// feeds right, right feeds back into left. That gives strict alternation.
// Cross-feeding both lines from a stereo input, which is the other common
// implementation, gives two delays that lean rather than one that bounces.

// --- Reverb ----------------------------------------------------------------
// A Dattorro/Griesinger plate: input diffusion into a figure-of-eight tank,
// output taken as a fistful of decorrelated taps from inside the tank.
//
// Structure (Dattorro, "Effect Design Part 1: Reverberator and Other
// Filters", JAES 1997), with the delay lengths scaled from the paper's
// 29761 Hz reference to whatever rate we were prepared at:
//
//   in -> mono -> pre-delay -> bandwidth LP -> 4 diffusion allpasses -> x
//   left  half: (x + right output) -> modulated AP -> delay -> damping ->
//               decay -> AP -> delay -> right half
//   right half: (x + left output)  -> modulated AP -> delay -> damping ->
//               decay -> AP -> delay -> left half
//
// Decisions:
//
//   * Decay is a TIME, in seconds, not a dimensionless feedback number. The two
//     per-loop multipliers are solved for the requested RT60 from the actual
//     loop length at the actual sample rate: g = 10^(-1.5*loop/(sr*rt60)), so
//     g^2 per loop is exactly -60 dB after rt60 seconds. A "decay" knob from 0
//     to 1 means nothing to a user and cannot be tested; a knob in seconds is
//     both a promise and a measurement.
//   * The tank's first allpass in each half is modulated by a slow quadrature
//     LFO (~0.7 and ~1.1 Hz, a few samples of excursion). This is what stops
//     the tank's modes from ringing on a fixed set of frequencies -- an
//     unmodulated plate on a sustained note sounds metallic within a second.
//   * The input is summed to mono before the tank, which is what a plate is:
//     one driver, one sheet. Stereo comes from taking the output taps in two
//     different sets, and the Width control collapses those towards mono
//     without collapsing the reverb itself.
//   * Damping is a one-pole lowpass inside each half of the tank, so it
//     compounds once per pass: high frequencies decay faster than low ones,
//     which is the single largest difference between a reverb that sounds like
//     a room and one that sounds like a delay network.
//
// Defaults: 20 ms pre-delay, 2 s decay, 6 kHz damping, 25% wet. Audible,
// flattering, and nowhere near loud enough to be destructive on a first play.

// --- Auto Filter -----------------------------------------------------------
// Resonant multimode filter (12 dB/oct lowpass, bandpass or highpass) with an
// LFO and an envelope follower on its cutoff.
//
// THE TEMPO SITUATION AGAIN, and the same answer as the Delay's, on purpose:
// PluginInstance carries no transport, so a tempo-synced LFO cannot know the
// session's BPM. The division table, the beats-to-hertz conversion and the Sync
// switch are all implemented; the number they multiply comes from a `Tempo`
// PARAMETER defaulting to 120, exactly as the Delay's does, and the user (or an
// automation lane) has to keep it in agreement with the transport. Everything
// except the source of that one number is done.
//
// The contract addition that would retire the wart on both devices at once is
// written out in full in the Delay's header, and adding it is a change to
// host.h and to engine.cpp's process loop rather than to this file.
//
// Three decisions worth stating:
//
//   * TPT state-variable filter, not a biquad. The cutoff moves continuously —
//     that is the device — and a direct-form section swept fast can leave the
//     stability triangle between two samples because its state stops meaning
//     anything once the coefficients have moved. The TPT form's state IS the
//     two integrator outputs, which survive a coefficient change. See
//     internal_dsp.h.
//   * The modulators run at CONTROL RATE (kCtrl = 16 samples, 0.33 ms at
//     48 kHz) and the coefficients are ramped linearly to the new target over
//     the following 16 samples. An LFO at its fastest (20 Hz over 4 octaves)
//     moves the cutoff by 0.03 octaves in one tick, which no ear resolves, and
//     the ramp is what stops that step from being a step. The alternative — a
//     tan() and an exp2() per sample per channel — buys nothing audible for
//     roughly ten times the cost.
//   * The envelope follower is stereo-LINKED and reads the peak, for the same
//     reason the Compressor's detector does: two independent followers pull the
//     stereo image around every time one side is louder.
//
// Defaults: lowpass, cutoff at the top of its range, no LFO and no envelope. A
// filter that reshapes the sound the moment it is dropped on a channel is a
// filter people delete; this one is a wire until a knob moves, like EQ Three.

//
//   * ONE oscillator, read at N angles. Every voice is the same rotating unit
//     vector (dsp::Quad) read at a fixed offset, because sin(t + a) is
//     s*cos a + c*sin a and the offsets are constants for the block. N
//     independent LFOs would cost N sines per sample and would drift apart at
//     the same time -- the offsets are the whole point of an ensemble.
//   * The two channels are in QUADRATURE, always: right reads the same
//     oscillator a quarter cycle ahead of left. That fixed offset, not a
//     parameter, is what makes the device stereo out of a mono source.
//   * Width is therefore a mid/side control on the WET signal, per sample and
//     smoothed, rather than a phase offset. A phase offset can only change at
//     block boundaries -- it is baked into the per-voice constants -- and a
//     delay time that steps once per block is a click.
//   * Feedback is taken from the summed wet signal and clamped before it
//     re-enters the line, so a NaN arriving from upstream cannot become
//     permanent state in a loop. Negative feedback is allowed and is what turns
//     a slow chorus into a flanger.
//
// Defaults: 3 voices, 12 ms, 3 ms of depth at 0.6 Hz, no feedback, 50% wet.
// Audible on the first play, which is the point of the device -- unlike a
// filter or an EQ, a chorus that does nothing by default is just latency.

// --- Limiter ---------------------------------------------------------------
// Lookahead brickwall limiter. The one internal device with latency, and the
// reason the base class's latencyFrames() comment names an exception.
//
// THE LATENCY, first, because it is the part the rest of the program depends
// on. The lookahead is five milliseconds, FIXED AT PREPARE TIME -- 240 frames
// at 48 kHz, 221 at 44.1 -- and latencyFrames() reports exactly that. It is not
// a parameter and must never become one:
//
//   * host.h says latency is constant after prepare();
//   * engine.cpp reads it ONCE, when a chain is published, and caches it beside
//     the pointer (see docs/RACKS.md §1);
//   * so a knob that changed the figure would leave every parallel path in the
//     project compensated by a number that is no longer true, silently, with no
//     way for the engine to find out.
//
// A device that under-reports smears the whole set; a device that over-reports
// does the same in the other direction. The number here is not an estimate --
// the output IS the input delayed by exactly `look_` samples (the test measures
// it by impulse), so the engine's compensation is exact rather than close.
//
// THE GAIN COMPUTER, and why this shape is brickwall rather than nearly:
//
//   1. level[n]   = 20*log10(peak of the stereo pair, after input gain)
//   2. rel[n]     = max(level[n], rel[n-1] released towards it)   -- release
//   3. m[n]       = max over rel[n-L .. n]                        -- lookahead
//   4. a[n]       = mean of m[n-L .. n]                           -- smoothing
//   5. gain[n]    = 10^(-max(0, a[n] - ceiling)/20), applied to input[n-L]
//
// Each stage is monotone upward in the level it reports, and the proof that the
// output cannot exceed the ceiling is three lines:
//   * rel[n] >= level[n], because step 2 only ever holds the level UP;
//   * every term of the mean in step 4 is m[n-j] for j <= L, and each of those
//     is a maximum over a window that CONTAINS index n-L (that is exactly what
//     makes L the right window length in both steps 3 and 4), so every term is
//     >= rel[n-L] >= level[n-L];
//   * therefore a[n] >= level[n-L], the attenuation applied to sample n-L is at
//     least what that sample needed, and |output| <= ceiling. No overshoot, at
//     any release time, for any signal.
//
// Release BEFORE the maximum, not after, is what makes that proof work and is
// the one ordering in the chain that is not free to move: smoothing after the
// maximum would let the gain arrive late.
//
// The attack is not a parameter either, because it is not a free variable: it
// is the mean in step 4, i.e. a linear ramp exactly `look_` samples long that
// finishes precisely when the peak arrives. That is what lookahead buys.
//
// Inter-sample peaks are NOT limited: this is a sample-peak limiter, and a
// signal that reads -0.1 dBFS here can still reconstruct above 0 dBFS in a
// converter. Saying so is cheaper than an oversampled detector nobody asked
// for, and the default ceiling of -0.3 dB is the usual allowance.

// --- Utility ---------------------------------------------------------------
// Gain, stereo width, mono fold, polarity and a DC blocker. The device with no

//
// THE PROPERTY THAT MATTERS: at its defaults it is a BIT-EXACT WIRE. Not
// "transparent", not "within a fraction of a dB" -- the samples that come out
// are the samples that went in. That is what makes it safe to leave on every
// channel, and it is a claim that has to be engineered rather than hoped for,
// because the obvious implementation destroys it:
//
//     mid = (L+R)/2;  side = (L-R)/2;  out = mid + side
//
// is NOT L in floating point. So Width == 1 is a BRANCH, not a computation, and
// the same reasoning puts a branch on the limiter's unity gain. Everything else
// on the identity path is a multiply by exactly 1.0f, which is exact.
//
// Order of operations, and why: DC block, then polarity, then width, then gain.
//   * The DC blocker is first so it sees the signal as it arrived, before a
//     polarity flip has changed the sign of the offset it is tracking.
//   * Polarity is before width, so inverting one side and folding to mono
//     cancels -- which is exactly what someone flipping a polarity switch is
//     listening for.
//   * Gain is last, so the knob is a true output level whatever the rest does.
//
// Mono is Width 0 with a switch of its own, because folding to mono is the one
// width setting people reach for by name. It moves the same smoother, so the
// switch glides rather than clicks.
//
// Polarity is smoothed too, over 20 ms. Flipping it therefore dips through zero
// rather than stepping, which is the lesser of two artefacts: a true crossfade
// would need the un-inverted copy kept alive in a second buffer for the sake of
// a switch nobody automates at audio rate.

// --- Rack ------------------------------------------------------------------

// THE WHOLE IDEA: a rack is a PluginInstance that owns PluginInstances. It

// it*, which is where all the interesting decisions are:
//
//   * latencyFrames() is the SUM of the chain, and is summed ON DEMAND rather
//     than cached, so that a rack nested inside this one can gain a latent
//     device without this rack's figure going stale. Reporting 0 would be a lie
//     the engine acts on -- it compensates with the number we give it, so a
//     rack containing the stock Limiter would smear every parallel path in the
//     project by exactly the amount we failed to declare.
//   * midi() is forwarded to sub-devices that declare a note input, so a rack
//     can contain an instrument.
//   * setParamRT() drives macros from the automation path, which means the
//     macro -> target scaling runs on the audio thread and must be a pure
//     lerp over values resolved at edit time.
//   * bypass short-circuits the entire chain, not each device individually.
//
// THREADING, in full, because a container has a problem a leaf device does not.
// The audio thread walks a chain that the GUI thread can edit underneath it.
// The chain and the mappings are therefore never mutated in place: an edit
// builds a COMPLETE NEW Layout and publishes it with one release store, and
// process()/midi()/setParamRT() take one acquire load and then read a structure
// nobody will ever touch again.
//
// A LAYOUT IS RETIRED, NEVER REWRITTEN, and that is audit 3's CRITICAL-2.
//
// This used to be a ring of four slots, on the argument that "four edits would
// have to land inside a single audio block before the layout being read could
// be rewritten -- that is a user's hand against a 5.3 ms block at 256 frames".
// The premise was false the day setState() existed. setState() is not a user's
// hand: it clears the chain (one republish), adds each device (one each), adds
// each mapping (one each) and closes (one more), so restoring a rack of two
// devices and two mappings wraps a four-slot ring TWICE, in microseconds, on
// the pump thread, while the audio thread is holding a Layout* for the whole
// block. ThreadSanitizer reports it as a write to Layout::n and to Layout::dev[]
// racing process()'s reads of both -- and dev[] is an array of POINTERS to
// sub-devices, past the torn `n`, from generations old enough that reclaim()
// has since destroyed them.
//
// So a displaced Layout goes on `retired_` and is freed by reclaim(), exactly
// as an unlinked sub-device is, at a moment the CALLER knows is quiet -- which
// is the one thing no code inside a PluginInstance can know for itself
// (docs/RACKS.md §2). Both callers already have that proof: the daemon rides
// the chain-retirement drain proof, and the GUI calls reclaim() from the device
// panel. The published Layout is heap-owned and immutable from the release
// store on, so there is nothing left for a reader to race.
//
// The cost is one ~1.4 KB allocation per structural edit, on the GUI thread,
// beside the reg_->instantiate() an edit already pays for. Growth between
// reclaims is bounded by edits and is a LEAK if a caller never reclaims -- the
// deliberate direction of the trade, and the same one the arrangement
// retirement takes: a block nobody frees costs memory, a block freed under a
// voice costs the process. kLayoutWarn names it in the log rather than
// capping it, because refusing an edit would be a rack that silently does not
// change.
//
// What that buys is safe UNLINKING. What it cannot buy is safe DELETION: no
// code inside a PluginInstance can know when the audio thread last dereferenced
// a pointer. So a removed sub-device is retired, not deleted -- it stays owned
// by the rack until the rack dies or RackControl::reclaim() is called at a
// moment the caller knows is quiet. Retiring is bounded (kOwnedCap) so a script
// hammering removeDevice() fails loudly instead of eating memory.
