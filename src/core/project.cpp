// Version 2 adds: `nextuid` at the top level, a `uid` line on every track,
// scene and clip, the clip's generative fields (prob / follow / followbeats),
// and `device` blocks inside a track.
//
// Version 3 adds MIDI clips: a `kind midi` line and zero or more `note` lines
// inside a clip block. An audio clip writes neither, so every set that has no
// MIDI in it saves exactly the bytes version 2 saved -- only the header line
// moves.
//
// Version 4 adds the mixer's bus topology: `send <idx> <level>` lines inside a
// track, `return <idx>` ... `endreturn` blocks and one `master` ... `endmaster`
// block between the tracks and the scenes. Every one of those constructs is
// emitted only when it carries something (see writeTrack's send loop,
// returnWorthWriting and writeMaster), so a set that uses none of them -- which
// is every set written before this version existed -- again saves exactly the
// bytes version 3 saved apart from the header line.
//
// Version 5 adds clip automation. A clip block gains, after its notes, zero or
// more `env <address>` ... `endenv` blocks:
//
//     env t:7/dev:12/p:3
//       pt 0 200
//       pt 2 4000
//     endenv
//
// with an optional `off` line marking a deactivated lane. Every part of it is
// sparse in the same way everything above is -- a clip with no envelopes writes
// nothing, a lane with no points is dropped, `off` appears only when the lane
// is disabled and the curve byte only when it is non-zero -- so a set that uses
// none of it saves exactly the bytes version 4 saved apart from the header
// line. See writeClip and validAddress for the details.
//
// Version 6 adds the arrangement (docs/ARRANGEMENT.md §8) and the clip's warp
// map. Three things are new:
//
//   * two top-level lines, `loop <start> <end>` and `loopon <0|1>`, beside
//     `tempo` and `quantum` -- there is one timeline and one brace, so they
//     belong to the set and not to a track. Both sparse: a brace that is off at
//     the default range writes nothing;
//   * an `arrangement` ... `endarrangement` block inside a track, after its
//     clips, holding a sparse `arrheight`, zero or more positional `aclip`
//     blocks (an item's seven fields, then a clip body identical to a `clip`'s)
//     and zero or more `autolane <address>` ... `endautolane` blocks, whose
//     `pt` and `off` lines are `env`'s verbatim;
//   * `wm <srcFrame> <beat>` lines inside an audio clip, one per warp marker.
//
// Every one of them is sparse in the way everything above is -- a set with no
// arrangement emits no `arrangement` block, no `loop`, no `loopon`, and a clip
// with no markers emits no `wm` -- so a set that uses none of it saves exactly
// the bytes version 5 saved apart from the header line.
//
// The `aclip` body is written by ONE shared writeClipBody and read by ONE
// shared clipBodyKey, which is what makes an item's payload PROVABLY the same
// grammar as a slot clip's -- `env` blocks, kind gating and the endclip checks
// included -- rather than a second copy that agrees today and drifts at the next
// format addition.
//
// There is deliberately ONE parser for all versions rather than a reader per
// version. The additions are all new keys with defaults, so an older file
// simply never mentions them and comes out with the defaults; the version
// number gates nothing on the read side beyond the upper bound. The
// alternative -- rejecting v3 keys inside a file that calls itself v1 -- would
// only punish someone who hand-edited the header, and buys no safety: an old
// build already refuses every one of those keys, so no half-understood file
// can be read either way. Saving always writes the current version.
//
// THE HEADER WORD IS THE MAGIC. There is no separate signature: the first
// token of the first line both identifies the format and carries the version.
// The product was called Lattice through versions 1..4, so that token was
// `lattice`; it is `nxtakt` from the rename on. Both spellings name the SAME
// format in the SAME version space (1..5 and counting) -- the rename did not
// fork the format, and a `nxtakt 4` file is byte-identical to the `lattice 4`
// file it replaced apart from that one word.
//
// So: the writer emits `nxtakt <version>`, and the reader accepts either word,
// forever. Not for a deprecation window -- forever. Every set a user has ever
// saved says `lattice`, those files are their work, and there is no upgrade
// step they could be expected to run. Dropping the old spelling would turn
// every one of them into "not a project file", which is the single worst thing
// a DAW can say about a file that is in fact perfectly readable.
//
// Deliberately NOT done: rewriting the caller's file on load, or keeping the
// word that was read so a re-save preserves it. Load-and-save flips the header
// to the new spelling, and that is the only thing it flips. See
// kHeaderWord/isHeaderWord below.
// Version 7 adds time-signature CHANGES, and adds them to the line that was
// already there. `sig` gains a three-token form:
//
//     sig 4 4          the session signature, at bar 0 -- v1's line, unchanged
//     sig 16 3 4       from bar 16 on, 3/4
//     sig 24 7 8       from bar 24 on, 7/8
//
// The two-token form is bar 0 and stays the canonical spelling for it, which is
// the whole reason the bar was appended to the FRONT of the new form rather than
// the back: a set in one signature -- which is every set that exists -- writes
// the identical byte sequence it wrote at v6, so the v6 -> v7 diff for it is
// exactly the header line. Later changes are sparse in the way everything above
// is sparse: no changes, no extra lines.
//
// Denominators are powers of two in 1..32 and numerators are 1..32
// (clSigNum/clSigDen in session.h, applied on save and on load like every other
// clamp here). Changes are sorted and deduplicated on load, last-wins, by
// Session::normalizeSigs -- the same normalizer every edit and the publisher
// use, so a hand-written file and an edited one cannot land in different shapes.
// Version 8 adds device STATE: one optional `state <opaque>` line inside a
// `device` block, carrying whatever a device needs to describe itself beyond
// its parameters.
//
//     device
//       uid 12
//       plugin nxtakt:rack
//       name Rack
//       bypass 0
//       param 1 0.4
//       state nxrack1;m=0,0,0.4,0,0,0,0,0;d=nxtakt%3Aeq3,0,-,0:100;x=2,0,0,6,30
//     enddevice
//
// Today exactly one device writes it -- `nxtakt:rack`, whose whole contents are
// that one line -- and THIS FILE DOES NOT KNOW THAT. The value is an opaque
// scalar: stored verbatim, escaped by esc() like any other string, never parsed
// here. src/core owns the project format, src/plugin owns what a rack means,
// and the string is the seam. (It is also what keeps gen_demo linkable: the
// rack's codec lives in internal_devices.cpp, which the tool does not link.)
//
// The compact form is printable ASCII with no whitespace by construction, so
// esc()/unesc() are the identity on everything the rack writes and the line
// round-trips byte for byte. A hand-edited file that puts a newline or a tab in
// there round-trips too, through the escapes every other string uses.
//
// Sparse, like everything since v2: a device with no state writes no line, so a
// set with no rack in it -- which is every set that existed before this version
// -- produces the identical bytes v7 produced apart from the header line.
//
// A state the rack layer cannot parse is NOT a parse error here. It cannot be:
// the format has no way to tell an unreadable state from one written by a newer
// build, and refusing the file would lose a whole set over one device. The
// string survives the round trip either way; the rack drops what it cannot read
// when it restores, exactly as a `param` naming a control the plugin no longer
// has is dropped.
//
// Version 9 adds the set's KEY and the per-note generative fields, and adds no
// block and no nesting to do it.
//
//     scale 9 2            A Minor  (root 9 = A, mode 2 = Minor)
//     scalesnap 1          edits are pulled into that scale
//     ...
//       note 0 0.5 57 100          an ordinary note, four fields, as at v3
//       note 0.5 0.5 60 92 60      ... that sounds six times in ten
//       note 1 0.5 64 100 100 70   ... always, at a velocity between 70 and 100
//
// Both key lines are sparse and mode 0 (Chromatic) is the default, so a set
// nobody has keyed writes neither. The root is folded to 0 when the mode is
// Chromatic: the value a missing line loads as must be exactly the value that
// suppresses it, and a root remembered under a scale that is switched off would
// otherwise be written by the first save and dropped by the second.
//
// The two note fields are POSITIONAL, so the chance is written whenever the
// range is even at its default -- there is no way to spell the second without
// the first, and inventing one (a `noteX` line, a key=value tail) would be a
// second grammar inside a format that has exactly one. The cost is one extra
// token on the rare note that has a velocity range and no chance; the benefit
// is that a note using neither emits the identical four fields v3 through v8
// emitted, and therefore that a set with no per-note dice in it differs from its
// v8 self by exactly the header line.
//
// This is the first version to make `note` STRICTER rather than only wider. It
// used to ignore anything after its four fields; it now reads a fifth and sixth
// and REFUSES a fifth that is not a number, which is `pt`'s rule since v5 and
// exists for the same reason: "absent" and "present but unreadable" have to be
// distinguishable, or a typo loads as the value that hides it. No file this
// program has ever written has a fifth field, so nothing that used to load
// stops loading.
// v10 adds the markers (locators), one sparse `marker <beat> <color> <name...>`
// line each, top level beside `loop`. See project.h for the full note and for
// why the name is the tail of the line rather than a field in the middle of it.
// A set with no markers writes none, so it differs from its v9 self by exactly
// the header line.

// parameter addresses -- SHAPE ONLY

//
// An automation lane names its target by canonical address (docs/PARAM-ADDRESS.md,
// plus the `send:` segment AUTOMATION.md §4.1 adds). The reader checks that
// text against the grammar and NOTHING ELSE. It never asks whether track uid 7
// exists, whether device uid 12 is in the set, or whether the plugin declaring
// param 3 is installed on this machine -- resolution lives GUI-side, and
// PARAM-ADDRESS.md's "dangling addresses resolve to nothing and must fail soft"
// is the whole reason the address is stored as text in the first place.
//
// That gives the two halves of AUTOMATION.md §7.2, which is the same split
// `send <idx> <level>` already makes one screen up:
//
//   * Syntactically malformed -> the load FAILS. It is structure. There is no
//     right answer for what `t:7//vol` or `t:seven/vol` meant, and guessing
//     would silently move somebody's automation onto a different parameter.
//   * Syntactically valid but naming a uid nothing answers to -> KEPT, and
//     written back unchanged on the next save. Losing a filter sweep because
//     the set was opened on a machine without the plugin is the worst bug this
//     feature can have; it is the same promise ClipModel::path makes for a
//     missing sample and DeviceModel::lostParams for a missing plugin.
//
// Grammar, from PARAM-ADDRESS.md:
//
//     address   := scope ( "/" segment )?
//     scope     := "master" | "t:" UID | "s:" UID
//     segment   := "vol" | "pan" | "mute" | "solo" | "arm" | "launch"
//                | "send:" INDEX
//                | "dev:" UID "/p:" PARAMID
//                | "clip:" UID "/" clipfield
//     clipfield := gain | prob | follow | followBeats | warp | loop
//
// Three readings of that grammar are decisions rather than transcription, and
// all three lean the same way -- toward accepting -- because a false reject
// costs the user the whole file while a false accept costs a lane that
// resolves to nothing:
//
//   * The document writes the segment list as `( "/" segment )*`. It is read
//     here as "at most one": every alternative is already a complete leaf and
//     no two of them compose, so `t:7/vol/pan` is a typo, not a nesting.
//   * A bare scope (`master`, `t:7`) has zero segments and is ACCEPTED. It
//     names no field, so it resolves to nothing -- which is a resolution
//     outcome, handled by the rule above, not a shape error.
//   * `launch` appears in PARAM-ADDRESS.md only as the reserved `s:4/launch`
//     example and not in the segment list at all. It is accepted for any
//     scope: policing which fields belong to which scope is resolution, and
//     rejecting a reserved spelling that a future build emits would be exactly
//     the failure mode this function exists to avoid.
//
// Ranges are not checked either, for the same reason: `t:7/send:99` names a bus
// this build does not have, and that is a dangling address, not a broken one.
// (Contrast the track's own `send 99 0.5` line, which IS rejected -- there the
// index is a slot in a fixed array this file is writing into, so there is
// nowhere to put it. Here it is text that round-trips.)

// A decimal u64 with at least one digit and nothing else. Leading zeros are
// fine -- the text is written back verbatim, so `t:007` costs nothing -- but a
