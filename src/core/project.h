// Project persistence.
//
// The on-disk format is line-oriented plain text rather than binary or JSON:
// a set that a user can diff, grep, and hand-repair after a bad merge is worth
// far more than the bytes a packed layout would save, and it keeps the core
// free of a serialization dependency.
//
// Version 2 of the format adds stable identifiers (`nextuid` plus a `uid` on
// every track, scene and clip), the clip's generative fields, and a track's
// device chain. A device is read and written only as the passive SavedDevice
// form, so nothing here knows how to instantiate a plugin.
//
// Version 3 adds MIDI clips. A clip block gains a `kind midi` line and, after
// its scalars, one `note <beat> <length> <pitch> <velocity>` line per note.
// Audio clips write neither line, so a set without MIDI in it produces the same
// bytes version 2 produced apart from the header. A MIDI clip in turn omits the
// four fields that only describe sample playback (`file`, `warp`, `bpm`,
// `range`) and keeps everything musical, `beats` -- the clip length the piano
// roll edits -- included. Notes are written and read in vector order; keeping
// them sorted by beat is the editor's job, not the format's.
//
// Version 4 adds the mixer's bus topology. A track gains sparse
// `send <idx> <level>` lines (only the buses it actually feeds), and two new
// top-level blocks sit between the tracks and the scenes: `return <idx>` ...
// `endreturn`, carrying a uid, a name, a fader and a device chain, and one
// `master` ... `endmaster` carrying nothing but a device chain. Both are
// emitted only when they hold something -- a return that is still the default
// bus, and an empty master chain, write nothing at all -- so a set that uses
// none of this produces the same bytes version 3 produced apart from the
// header. Devices in a return or on the master are the same passive
// SavedDevice blocks a track writes, read and written through the same code.
//
// Version 5 adds clip automation. A clip block gains, after its notes, zero or
// more `env <address>` ... `endenv` blocks, each holding an optional `off` line
// (the lane is deactivated) and one `pt <beat> <value> [curve]` line per
// breakpoint. A clip with no envelopes emits nothing, an envelope with no
// points is dropped, and the curve byte is written only when non-zero -- so a
// set that uses none of this again produces the same bytes version 4 produced
// apart from the header. Envelopes are NOT gated on clip kind: an audio clip
// may carry them too.
//
// Version 6 adds the arrangement (docs/ARRANGEMENT.md §8) and warp markers.
// Two top-level lines, `loop <start> <end>` and `loopon <0|1>`, carry the one
// timeline's brace. A track gains an `arrangement` ... `endarrangement` block
// after its clips, holding a sparse `arrheight`, zero or more POSITIONAL
// `aclip` ... `endaclip` blocks -- an item's `at`/`len`/`off`/`fadein`/
// `fadeout`/`fadeshape`/`source`, then a clip body byte-for-byte identical to a
// slot clip's, written and read by the same two functions -- and zero or more
// `autolane <address>` ... `endautolane` blocks, whose `pt` and `off` lines are
// `env`'s verbatim in absolute timeline beats. A clip gains `wm <srcFrame>
// <beat>` lines, one per warp marker, on audio clips only.
//
// Every construct is sparse: a set with no arrangement writes no block, no
// brace and no height, and a clip with no markers writes no `wm` -- so such a
// set again produces the same bytes version 5 produced apart from the header.
// The one thing the format does NOT do is sort: `aclip` order is file order
// here, and the sort the engine's cursor depends on belongs to App::adoptSession,
// beside the editing code that upholds the invariant.
//
// Version 7 adds time-signature CHANGES, on the `sig` line that was already
// there. `sig <num> <den>` still means the session signature at bar 0 and is
// still written exactly as it was; `sig <bar> <num> <den>` adds a change, one
// sparse line each, sorted and deduplicated last-wins on load. A set in one
// signature -- which is every set that existed before this version -- therefore
// writes the identical bytes version 6 wrote apart from the header line.
// Numerators are 1..32 and denominators are powers of two in 1..32; a
// denominator between two powers rounds down, so the clamp is stable across a
// re-save.
//
// Version 8 adds one optional `state <opaque>` line inside a `device` block:
// whatever that device needs to describe itself beyond its parameters, as a
// single line of text this layer stores verbatim and never parses. Exactly one
// device writes it today -- `nxtakt:rack` puts its entire contents there -- and
// the format deliberately does not know that. A device with no state writes no
// line, so a set with no rack in it again produces the identical bytes version
// 7 produced apart from the header. A state string the device layer cannot make
// sense of is not a parse error: it round-trips, and the device drops what it
// cannot use, exactly as a `param` naming a control that no longer exists is
// dropped.
//
// Version 9 adds the set's KEY and the piano roll's per-note generative
// fields, and does both by widening lines that were already there rather than
// by adding blocks.
//
// Two top-level lines carry the key: `scale <root> <mode>`, where root is a
// pitch class 0..11 and mode indexes the table in session.h, and `scalesnap
// <0|1>`, whether edits are held to it. Mode 0 is Chromatic, which is what "no
// scale" is spelled as, and the whole pair is sparse: a Chromatic set writes no
// `scale` line and therefore no root either, which is why the root is folded to
// 0 on the way out when there is no scale -- the value a missing line loads as
// has to be exactly the value that suppresses it, and a remembered-but-unused
// root would break that on the second save.
//
// `note` grows two OPTIONAL trailing fields, `note <beat> <length> <pitch>
// <velocity> [<chance> [<velrange>]]`. Chance is 0..100 percent and defaults to
// 100; velrange is 0 (a fixed velocity) or the far end of a velocity span, and
// defaults to 0. Neither is written at its default, and because they are
// positional the chance is written whenever the range is -- so a note that uses
// neither emits the identical four fields version 8 emitted, and a set with no
// per-note dice in it differs from its v8 self by exactly the header line.
//
// The one behaviour this changes for an OLD file is that `note` used to ignore
// whatever trailed its four fields and now reads two more numbers off it. That
// costs nothing for any file this program has ever written -- it never wrote a
// fifth field -- and it buys the same "absent and unreadable are different
// things" strictness `pt` has had since v5: a fifth field that is not a number
// is a broken line and says so, rather than silently loading as the value that
// suppresses it.
//
// Version 10 adds the arrangement's MARKERS (locators): named points on the
// timeline, one sparse top-level line each,
//
//     marker <beat> <color> <name...>
//
// beside `loop` and `loopon`, because there is one timeline and these are
// positions on it. Written in normalized order (sorted by beat, unique beats),
// so the file is the same list the ruler draws and a hand-edited one is sorted
// on the way in rather than being trusted.
//
// THE NAME IS LAST, and it is last so that spaces in it survive. Every other
// line in this format is either all numbers or ends in one free-text field, and
// the free-text field is always the tail: `name`, `plugin`, `state` and
// `autolane <address>` all take the whole remainder of the line and unescape it
// (see `kv`/`unesc`). A marker's two numbers therefore come first and are
// scanned, and whatever is left -- spaces, punctuation, unicode and all -- is
// the name. An EMPTY name is written as the bare `marker <beat> <color>`, which
// is `kv`'s bare form applied to a line that has other fields in front of it,
// and reads back as the empty string.
//
// The colour is a POSITIONAL field rather than a sparse one, unlike the note's
// chance and velrange, and for the opposite reason those two are sparse: there
// is a free-text field behind it, so an omitted colour could not be told from a
// name that happens to begin with a number. Writing it always costs two bytes
// and removes the ambiguity entirely. Index 0 is the accent; the value is
// clamped to the field's own width and NOT to this build's palette, for the
// reason `curve` and `fadeshape` are -- see `struct Marker` in session.h.
//
// A set with no markers writes no `marker` line, so it produces the identical
// bytes version 9 produced apart from the header line.
//
// Saving always writes the current version; versions 1 through 10 all load,
// through one parser, with every field a file does not mention taking its
// default.
//
// NAMING, after the Lattice -> NxTakt rename:
//
//   * The header word is `nxtakt` on write and `nxtakt` OR `lattice` on read,
//     forever. It doubles as the format's magic, so this is what keeps every
//     already-saved set loadable. The full argument is at kHeaderWord in
//     project.cpp.
//   * The file EXTENSION stays `.lattice`. This is a deliberate hold, not an
//     oversight. The extension is not a compatibility problem the way the
//     header word is -- the loader never looks at it -- but changing it is a
//     user-facing problem: it splits a user's own set folder into two
//     extensions with no way to tell which build wrote which, it invalidates
//     whatever file-manager association and shell glob they have built up, and
//     it means `open recent` and muscle memory stop agreeing. A rename pass is
//     the wrong moment to spend that. If it does move (`.nxt` is the obvious
//     candidate), the change is: write the new extension, keep opening both,
//     and offer the new one as the default in the save dialog only.
//     Tracked as open; nothing in the codebase depends on the decision either
//     way, because nothing dispatches on the extension.
