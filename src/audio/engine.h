// The realtime engine.
//
// Threading contract. Every crossing is a lock-free SPSC ring or an atomic, and
// there is no lock anywhere in this file. Memory that is genuinely shared —
// clip samples, chains, note arrays, envelope sets, arrangement lanes, the
// signature map — is written by its owner, published once, never mutated after
// publication, and comes home in a retirement event before the owner may free
// it. See the RtNote comment below for the one rule all of them follow.
//   * GUI thread  -> pushCommand()      -> audio thread
//   * MIDI reader -> pushMidi()         -> audio thread
//   * GUI thread  -> pushMidiFromGui()  -> audio thread   (its own ring: one
//     producer per Ring, and two on one ring is a dropped note-off)
//   * audio thread -> popEvent()    on the GUI thread
//   * audio thread -> popJournal()  on the GUI thread
//   * scalar state the GUI polls (meters, playhead, clip states) lives in
//     std::atomic members.
// The engine has no pushEvent(): the audio thread is the only producer of
// events, so it writes the ring from inside process() and the GUI only ever
// pops. The audio thread never allocates, locks, or touches std::string; every
// allocation the engine makes happens in prepare(), on the GUI thread.

//
// `chance` and `velTo` are Live's per-note Chance and Velocity Range, and both
// are evaluated ON THE AUDIO THREAD at the moment the note-on would go out --
// the same place every other note decision is made, and the only place that
// knows which lap of the loop this is.
//
//   chance  0..100 percent. 100 (the default) skips the draw entirely, so a
//           pattern that does not use the feature costs exactly what it cost
//           before it existed. 0 never sounds; a note that loses its roll is
//           silent for that lap and does NOT release whatever is holding its
//           pitch, because a note that did not happen cannot end one that did.
//   velTo   0 (the default) means "fixed velocity, use `vel`". Anything else is
//           the far end of a velocity SPAN: each sounding is drawn uniformly
//           from the closed integer range between `vel` and `velTo`, in either
//           order, so a range may be written downwards without meaning
//           anything different.
//
// DETERMINISM is a hard requirement, not a nicety: this project's demo renders
// are cmp-identical gates. Neither draw uses a generator with state, for the
// reason spelled out at randUnit() in engine.cpp -- a stateful RNG's output
// depends on how many times it has been called, which depends on the buffer
// size. Both are a pure hash of the musical event: the track, the note's index

// mirrors this struct field for field and the note pool is a raw byte copy, so

    // the master chain), so a reader who knows one knows the other. The loop
    // brace rides this table instead of a Cmd::SetLoop because `Command` has one
    // f64 and a brace is two numbers and a flag: widening Command would grow
    // every entry of a 1024-deep ring and break WireCommand, which is 32 B,
    // pointer-free and load-bearing in the region layout hash.

    // one lane per address per track, evaluated in a pass that runs BEFORE the
    // clip envelope pass so that the clip's value wins by overwriting it (§6.4).
    SetTrackAutos,

    // a = 0 (reserved), x = the beat to go to. Flushes every sounding note-off
    // at frame 0, re-seeks every arrangement cursor, and ASSIGNS beat_ rather
    // than adding to it, so sixty-four laps of a loop accumulate no drift.
    // Deliberately leaves session voices alone: a locate is a statement about
    // the timeline, not about the performance a track is currently playing.
    Locate,

    // a = track, or -1 for every track. Clears the per-track override that a
    // session clip launch set, unquantized -- it is a corrective gesture, and a
    // correction that waits a bar is the wrong feel. The track's cursor
    // re-seeks to beat_ and resumes whatever item covers it, mid-item.
    BackToArrangement,

    // a = count, p = const RtSig* (null, or count 0, clears back to plain 4/4).
    // ONE allocation and ONE pointer -- the RtNote retirement rule verbatim, and
    // the reason the map is a flat array rather than a struct pointing at one:
    // there is exactly one array here, so there is exactly one pointer to talk
    // about and no rule needed about which retirement implies which. The
    // displaced array comes back in Ev::SigsRetired and may not be freed before.

    // A map that does not pass sigMapValid is REFUSED and handed straight back
