//
// randUnit hashes the ABSOLUTE beat a launch was scheduled for. That number is
// accumulated a block at a time (`beat_ = origin + (n - posOrigin) * bps`), so
// it differs by a few ulps between one buffer size and another; quantizing to
// 960 ticks per beat is what absorbs that, and it works because launches only
// ever land on a quantum grid, decimals away from a tick boundary.
//
// A NOTE has no such guarantee: a note may sit at any beat a piano roll or a
// MIDI take can produce, including one that lands within an ulp of a tick
// boundary, where two buffer sizes could round to two different ticks and
// therefore to two different dice. So none of the inputs here is an absolute
// beat at all:
//
//   track     - fixed for the voice.
//   noteIdx   - the note's index in its clip's array. Exact, integral.
//   pitch     - exact.
//   nt.beat   - read straight OUT OF THE ARRAY, never accumulated. It is the
//               same f64 the GUI published, bit for bit, at every buffer size.
//   lap       - Voice::lap, incremented once per loop wrap. A wrap happens
//               once per `lengthBeats` of playback by construction: the wrap
//               test is on the voice's own beat cursor against the loop length,
//               so the FRAME it lands on can move by a sample between buffer
//               sizes but the COUNT of wraps after N beats cannot.
//
// Every one of those is either an integer or a value copied verbatim from the
// published array. Nothing is summed across blocks, so there is nothing for a
// different block size to round differently, and the 960-tick quantization the
// launch path needs is not needed here -- the beat is hashed at full precision.
//
// `lap` is what makes a probabilistic pattern re-roll each time round the loop,
// which is the entire musical point of the feature; without it a 50% note would
// be a note that is either always there or never there. It resets with the
// voice, so relaunching a clip replays the same dice from the same place --
// deliberately, because that is what makes an offline render of a set
// reproducible and what lets the same bar be rendered twice and compared.

// warp map
//
// THE MODEL. A warp marker pins one source frame to one musical beat. A clip's
// markers are a sorted array; the invariant is that BOTH sequences are strictly
// increasing. That single invariant buys everything else:
//
//   * beat -> source is a bijection, so the inverse (source -> beat) exists and
//     is the same binary search on the other key;
//   * every segment has a finite, positive slope, so the LOCAL RATE — source
//     frames per beat — is well defined everywhere and never divides by zero;
//   * the map is piecewise linear and continuous, so a voice's read position is
//     a continuous function of the transport beat. No warp edit can make a
//     playing clip jump.
//
// Evaluating it is a bisection for the bracketing pair and one linear
// interpolation, exactly as autoValueAt does for envelopes, and for the same
// reason: it is called from the audio thread and from the UI (drawing the warp
// line, snapping a dragged marker) and the two must not be able to disagree.
// Before the first marker and after the last, the adjacent segment's slope is
// extrapolated — that is what lets a user pin two transients in the middle of a
// clip and have the rest of it follow sensibly, instead of the clip stopping
// dead outside the marked region.
//
// THE NO-MARKER CASE. A clip without markers is not a different code path, it
// is a map with one implicit segment: origin at loopStart, slope the clip's own
// tempo ratio. Conceptually. Arithmetically it IS given its own branch, and on
// purpose: `tempo_ / c.clipBpm` is the scalar every render this engine has ever
// produced was built on, and recomputing the same number as
// (60*sr/clipBpm) * (tempo/60/sr) is equal to it in algebra and not in doubles.
// The demo renders are the regression gate for this whole change, so the flat
// path keeps the original expression, character for character, and the marker
// path is new arithmetic that only runs when markers exist. WarpCtx::flatRate
// is that scalar and nothing else computes it.
//
// HOW A MAP REACHES THE ENGINE. On RtClip, and nowhere else (engine.h):
//
//     const WarpMarker* markers = nullptr;    // GUI-owned, sorted, immutable
//     int markerCount = 0;                    // 0 or >= 2; 1 is meaningless
//     const i64* transients = nullptr;        // sorted, SampleBuffer-owned
//     int transientCount = 0;
//
// `markers` rides the ONE-POINTER RETIREMENT RULE the notes and envelope arrays
// already follow (engine.h's RtNote comment, docs/AUTOMATION.md): the GUI
// heap-allocates one array per clip, ships it whole inside RtClip via
// Cmd::SetClip, never mutates it after publication, and may free a displaced
// array only after the engine hands the old pointer back in Ev::WarpRetired —
// pushed from the same place in drainCommands() that pushes Ev::NotesRetired,
// and only when the incoming pointer differs from the outgoing one, because
// re-pushing the same array must announce nothing. Cmd::ClearClip retires it
// too, and so does replacing the clip with one that carries no markers.
//
// `transients` deliberately has NO retirement event: they belong to the SAMPLE,
// not to the clip (two clips over one sample share one array), and
// SampleBuffer::transients is built once at load and never rebuilt (sample.cpp),
// so the pointer is stable for the life of the session exactly as RtClip::data
// already is. If that ever stops being true it takes the same protocol as
// `markers`.
//
// VALIDITY. warpMapValid() is the GUI-side gate and is O(n), so it runs once
// where the map is built and never on the audio thread; the realtime path checks
// only `markerCount >= 2`. That split is safe because the evaluators below are
// individually robust against a bad map — they return a point ON the map rather
// than reading out of bounds — so a map that slipped through costs a wrong read
// position and never a crash.

//   dry    voice -> track chain (Lt) -> fader/pan -> master sum
//   send   voice -> track chain (Lt) -> fader/pan -> send tap
//                -> return chain (Lr) -> return vol -> master sum
//   click  metronome ------------------------------> master sum   (no chain)
//   all of the above ------------------> master chain (Lm) -> master fader
//
// The send tap sits *after* the track chain, so both paths out of one track
// carry the same Lt: whatever aligns a track's dry signal aligns its sends with
// it for free. That splits the problem into two independent stages.
//
//   1. Tracks against each other. Delay track i by (maxLt - Lt_i). Afterwards
//      every track's post-fader signal — dry and tapped alike — sits at maxLt.
//   2. Returns against each other and against the dry sum. A return's output
//      now sits at maxLt + Lr_r while the dry sum sits at maxLt, so delay
//      return r by (maxLr - Lr_r) and the dry sum by maxLr. Everything then
//      lands at maxLt + maxLr.
//
// The metronome is not on a track and enters the graph at 0, so it takes the
// same maxLt a zero-latency track would (it gets its own line, applied while
// outL/outR still holds nothing but the click) and then rides the dry bus's
// maxLr along with the tracks.
//
// The master chain is in series with the whole sum — nothing runs in parallel
// beside it — so it needs no compensation at all. Its latency is simply part of
// what the engine publishes:
//
//   Engine::latencyFrames = maxLt + maxLr + Lm
//
// Returns have no sends of their own, so there is no return -> return path to
// align. Live gates that behind an option and so could we; it is deliberately
// out of this wave, and nothing above assumes its absence beyond stage 2.
//
// Two properties this implementation holds onto:
//   * A chain's latency is read exactly once, when the chain is published, and
//     cached beside the pointer. latencyFrames() is const after prepare() per
//     the PluginInstance contract, so calling it per block would be a virtual
//     call per device per block for an answer that cannot have changed.
//   * When no chain anywhere reports latency, not one delay line is touched and
//     the arithmetic is the pre-PDC arithmetic, sample for sample. A set with no
//     latent devices must render bit-identically to before this existed.
