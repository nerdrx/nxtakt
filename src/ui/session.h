// A scale is a ROOT (0..11, C..B) and a MODE, and a mode is nothing but a
// twelve-bit mask of the semitones it admits above its root. That is the whole
// model: no per-scale interval list, no note-name table to keep in step with
// it, and -- crucially -- one bit test to answer "is this pitch in key", which
// is a question the piano roll asks 128 times per frame per row map.
//
// Mode 0 is CHROMATIC and means "no scale". It is not a special case in the
// mask (it admits all twelve) but it is one in the UI and in the format: the
// highlight is off, fold-to-scale falls back to the full range, snapping is
// inert, and the project writer emits no line at all. That is what keeps a set
// nobody has keyed byte-identical to what it was before scales existed.
//
// THE SCALE IS THE SESSION'S, not the clip's. Live 12 puts it on the control
// bar for the whole set and lets a clip opt out; a per-clip key is the more
// general model and the wrong default, because the overwhelmingly common case
// is that a piece is in one key and every pattern in it should light up the
// same rows. A per-clip override is a strictly additive change to this struct
// if it is ever wanted, and costs nothing to leave out now.

//   * A marker carries a UID. Two markers may not share a beat (the normalizer
//     dedupes), but a DRAG moves one across others, and an index is a wrong-
//     marker edit the moment the sort reorders behind it -- the same argument
//     ArrangeClip::uid already makes, for the same gesture.
//   * There is no entry the list must contain. `sigs` must have bar 0 because a
//     piece is always in some signature; a piece with no named positions is the
//     normal case, and an empty list writes no lines at all.
//
// GUI-ONLY. Nothing here is published to the engine: a marker names a place, it
// does not change what is played there. The jump it produces is an ordinary
// Cmd::Locate, which is the command the ruler's own click has always sent.
