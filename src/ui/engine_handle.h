// EngineHandle — the one thing in the UI that knows where the engine is.
//
// docs/GUI-ON-DAEMON.md §2.1, option (b)+(c): a CONCRETE class holding whichever
// backing it was opened with, no vtable. The doc rejects a virtual IEngine
// explicitly and the reason is worth keeping in view: the dominant call class
// used to be twenty polled atomics read ~3 000 times a frame, so a virtual
// getter per field would have been twenty virtuals on the hot path plus twenty
// pairs of near-identical one-line overrides to keep in sync — an abstraction
// paying for the wrong axis. The snapshot (poll(), engine_state.h) removes the
// hot path entirely, and what is left is a handful of calls a frame where a
// branch on a member that never changes after init() predicts perfectly.
//
// TWO BACKINGS, AS OF STEPS 2 AND 3
// ---------------------------------
//   local    an Engine, an audio backend and the ALSA MIDI reader, all in this
//            process. What step 1 shipped and still the default.
//   daemon   an ipc::EngineClient talking to nxtaktd over the control region,
//            with the GUI's samples living in an ipc::SamplePool it owns.
//            NXTAKT_ENGINE=daemon (or LATTICE_ENGINE=daemon) selects it.
//
// `local()` answers null in daemon mode and that is the load-bearing test: no
// caller may assume there is an in-process Engine to reach.
//
// WHAT DAEMON MODE CARRIES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
// ----------------------------------------------
// Carried: transport, tempo, quantum, metronome, the mixer scalars, sends and
// return levels, every polled meter and indicator, the computer-MIDI keyboard
// and note previews, and — step 3 — session clips, both audio and MIDI, through
// the sample pool.
//
// Not carried yet, and refused *with a reason* rather than dropped (see
// remoteRefusals()): device chains (§5 step 4), recording (§7), the arrangement
// and its automation (which the daemon can take, but only as a pool blob this
// wave does not build), time signatures (Cmd::SetSignatures is outside
// ipc::commandIsKnown's bound, so the daemon answers RejectUnknownCommand and
// plays the set in 4/4), and hardware MIDI input (MidiInput pushes straight into
// an Engine, and in daemon mode there is not one — §1.3 moves it into nxtaktd).
//
// Threading: GUI thread only, like everything in src/ui. The Engine it owns in
// local mode is the one the audio thread runs; the ring pushes here are the
// producer side of the SPSC contract in core/ring.h. In daemon mode the same
// contract holds against the shared-memory rings, with this thread as the sole
// producer of commands and of MIDI.

    // --- devices (§5 step 4) ------------------------------------------------
    //
    // THERE IS NO addDevice() HERE, AND THAT IS THE DESIGN OF THIS STEP.
    //
    // §5 step 4 describes rewriting App's device code around device ids:
    // `DeviceModel::inst` deleted, `addDevice()` becoming "send CmdAddDevice and
    // wait for the event", the knobs reading a DeviceMirror. That is the right
    // end state and it is unreachable from these files — it edits
    // src/ui/session.h and src/ui/app_devices.cpp, and it would delete the
    // in-process path that §8 says stays supported through step 6.
    //
    // So the seam is put one level lower, at the one call every chain edit
    // already funnels through: App::publishChain() builds an RtChain and hands
    // it to pushCommand(). An RtChain cannot cross a process boundary — but
    // everything the daemon needs in order to BUILD ITS OWN is readable off it
    // through PluginInstance's virtuals: desc().uri, paramInfo(i).id,
    // getParam(i), bypassed(). So the remote path reads the chain the GUI
    // declared and reconciles the daemon toward it with AddDevice /
    // RemoveDevice / MoveDevice / SetBypass, then mirrors params every frame.
    //
    // Two consequences worth stating rather than discovering:
    //
    //   * The GUI's PluginInstance is not silent-and-pointless in daemon mode,
    //     it is the MODEL. It holds the parameter values, the bypass flag and
    //     the rack contents; it just never renders audio, because there is no
    //     in-process engine to call process(). That is exactly §4's split — the
    //     GUI is the authority on what exists, the engine on what sounds.
    //   * Instantiation is asynchronous, and the GUI does not currently know
    //     that. A device appears in the model at once and starts sounding a
    //     frame or several later (or, on the very first one, after the daemon's
    //     plugin scan). devicesPending() is how a status line says so.
    //
    // Params are addressed by ParamInfo::id, per docs/PARAM-ADDRESS.md: the GUI
    // and the daemon load the same plugin build, so the ids match, but the
    // INDEX ordering is not something either side promises the other. A control
    // whose id has no counterpart is counted, never guessed at.

    // What the daemon made of a device the GUI published, or null if this is
    // not the daemon path or the instance is not in any published chain.

    // crashes lilv here and not there. A browser drawn from the local
    // PluginRegistry can therefore offer a row whose double-click can only ever
    // fail, which is the whole reason §3 asked for a catalog table.
