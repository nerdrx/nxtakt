    //   * THE FL GESTURES (2026-08-26 usability pass). The owner is a long-time
    //     FL Studio user and these five are the ones his hands already know:
    //       - LEFT-DRAG PAINTS. A press on empty space still writes one note,
    //         and dragging on from it writes one into every further cell the
    //         pointer sweeps -- FL's paint brush. This REPLACES the old
    //         press-drag-add (which grabbed the fresh note and let you place
    //         it): the two gestures are the same pixels and only one of them
    //         can have them. Placing a note is now click-then-drag, two
    //         gestures that were always available, and sweeping a hi-hat line
    //         is one, which it was not.
    //       - RIGHT-DRAG ERASES. Right-click still deletes the note under the
    //         pointer; holding the button and sweeping deletes every note the
    //         pointer crosses, along the whole segment travelled and not just
    //         where the frames happened to land.
    //       - ALT FREES THE SNAP while a note is being moved or resized (Shift
    //         does too, except during a Shift-clone, where Shift is already
    //         spoken for). Alt is the documented one; it is FL's.
    //       - MIDDLE-DRAG PANS both axes, anywhere over the editor.
    //       - SHIFT+DRAG CLONES the selection, and so does Ctrl+drag. A shift
    //         PRESS on a note is ambiguous -- FL clones, this roll (and every
    //         other DAW) toggles set membership -- so the verdict waits for
    //         motion: released without moving, it toggles as it always did;
    //         moved, it leaves a copy behind and drags the copy.
    //     Ctrl+drag from empty space rubber-bands too, since that is where FL
    //     puts the marquee; Shift keeps doing it as well.
    //   * the selection is a SET. Shift+click a note toggles it in or out;
    //     plain-clicking a note that is already part of a multi-selection keeps
    //     the set (so the click can start a group drag) and otherwise reduces
    //     the selection to that one note. Shift+drag from empty grid space
    //     rubber-bands: an accent-outlined rect that adds every note it touches
    //     to the selection as it is dragged. (Plain drag from empty space still
    //     adds a note — the press-drag-add gesture is unchanged, which is why
    //     the band needs a modifier at all.) Every group edit — move, nudge,
    //     delete, velocity, duplicate — acts on the whole set; see the keyboard
    //     API below.
    //   * the bottom lane is a CHOOSER (docs/AUTOMATION.md §6.1, decision #9):
    //     it shows either the velocity stems or ONE of the clip's envelopes,
    //     never both. The selectors sit in the lane's key block, where the
    //     static "VEL" label used to be: what the lane shows, what "+" would
    //     add, and the shown lane's on/off toggle. Envelope editing uses the
    //     grid's own verbs — click empty space adds a breakpoint (grid-
    //     quantized in time, free in value), drag moves it, Alt frees the beat,
    //     Ctrl freezes it, right-click or double-click deletes, Shift+drag from
    //     empty space rubber-bands a set that then moves as one, Delete and the
    //     arrows act on the whole set. The lane uses the roll's OWN time axis,
    //     so zoom and scroll can never drift apart from the notes above.
    //   * an AUDIO clip gets the same editor with the note grid replaced by its
    //     waveform, drawn against that same time axis, so a sample's envelopes
    //     are edited where its transients are.
    //   * wheel = vertical scroll, Shift+wheel = horizontal, Ctrl+wheel = zoom
    //     the time axis about the cursor (kZoomMin..kZoomMax logical px/beat).
    //     A clip is first shown fit to the width; from the first Ctrl+wheel on,
    //     the zoom is the user's and is kept until the clip changes.
    //   * loop length readout + drag at the top-right of the ruler
    //     (whole-beat steps, min 1)
    //   * the SET'S KEY, passed in rather than owned: in-scale rows are lit and
    //     the root is lit brighter, the FOLD control gains a "KEY" mode that
    //     hides every out-of-scale row, and — when the key says so — every edit
    //     that chooses a pitch is pulled onto the nearest scale degree. The roll

    // any usable zoom -- a hit test on the landing point alone skips notes, and
    // a brush that skips is worse than no brush.
