// One automation lane: a breakpoint editor drawn against a caller-supplied
// time axis.
//
// This is the extraction docs/AUTOMATION.md §6.5 specified and argued for in
// advance — *"an audio clip has no piano roll and wants exactly this lane under
// its waveform, and a lane that was born inside the roll would have to be
// extracted then, with a live editor's state to carry across."* It did not
// happen when the lane shipped; it happens here, as a MOVE, because the
// arrangement's expandable lanes are the second caller decision 11 already
// referred to as though this class existed (docs/ARRANGEMENT.md §7.3).
//
// The lane owns NO time axis of its own. It is handed one, so the lane and
// whatever is above it can never disagree about where a beat is — which is the
// same reason the lane lived inside the roll in the first place, now stated as
// a parameter instead of as a file boundary.
//
// Deliberately knows nothing about App, ClipModel, devices or the engine: it
// edits a std::vector<AutoPoint> in place and reports whether it changed. What
// the lane may *name* — the address, the chooser, the "+" that adds one — is
// the caller's, because that is the part that differs between a clip envelope
// and a track lane.
