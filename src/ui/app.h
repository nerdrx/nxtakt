    // ENGINE FLOW CONTROL — deferred publication
    //   docs/ARRANGEMENT.md §15 (the bug), docs/GUI-ON-DAEMON.md §2.2 (the shape)
    //
    // pushAll() sends roughly 3 + tracks*9 + tracks*scenes commands in one
    // burst. A full 32x32 set is about 1320 of them against a 1024-deep ring
    // that the audio thread drains once per block, so an ordinary project load
    // or undo restore OVERFLOWED IT — and the failure mode was the bad kind:
    // pushClip logged and gave up, leaving the engine playing a clip the model
    // no longer believed in, with nothing scheduled to notice.
    //
    // The fix is flow control, not a bigger ring. A ring is a realtime
    // structure sized for the steady state; a burst that large wants to be
    // spread across frames.
    //
    // The shape, and the two properties that make it correct:
    //
    //   * IT QUEUES INTENT, NOT PAYLOAD. An entry says "cell (3,7) needs
    //     publishing", not "here is an RtClip". The allocation, the resolve and
    //     the retirement bookkeeping all happen at DRAIN time, from the model as
    //     it stands then. So a queued cell can be edited, cleared or fall
    //     outside a freshly loaded set before it drains and the right thing
    //     still happens — and a fader dragged for a second collapses into one
    //     publish instead of sixty.
    //   * IT IS ONE FIFO. While anything is waiting, every new command joins the
    //     back rather than going to the ring, so nothing can overtake something
    //     already queued. Two queues would have needed a rule about how they
    //     interleave, and the answer for (say) a queued Cmd::ClipGain against a
    //     fresh Cmd::SetClip for the same cell is not obvious.

    // state before this edit" needs no per-command inverse, no diff machinery,
    // and cannot drift out of sync with what the app can actually represent.
    // A restore is therefore a sibling of a project load and shares its body,
    // adoptSession(), retirement protocol included.
    //
    // The one thing the format does not carry is where the set lives on disk
    // (Session::path is bookkeeping about the last save, not content), and
    // undoing should not move the cursor to the other end of the grid, so the
    // path and the selection ride along beside the text.
    //
    // WHAT IS NOT UNDOABLE, and deliberately so:
    //   * transport -- playing, the playhead, which clips are launched or
    //     queued. Undo is an edit operation; a set that stopped playing because
    //     a note moved would be unusable on stage.
    //   * the record-intent button and per-track arm as such. Arm is session
    //     state and does come back with a restore, but clicking around the grid
    //     (which auto-arms, see selectTrack) never takes an undo point of its
    //     own -- selection is not an edit.
    //   * a take in flight. There is no coherent "half a recording" to restore
    //     to, so an undo during recording cancels the take first: the engine is
    //     told to stop, and the buffer it hands back is thrown away rather than
    //     turned into a clip (PendingRec::cancelled). The buffer itself is
    //     still freed only on the RecordFinished handshake.
    //   * plugin state beyond the parameters a plugin exposes. What is captured
    //     is exactly what a saved set captures -- id/value pairs -- so a
    //     plugin's internal editor state, its samples, its preset name are not
    //     restored. A rebound instance additionally keeps whatever it holds
    //     internally, which is the same trade a saved set makes.
