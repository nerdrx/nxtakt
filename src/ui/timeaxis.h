// This is a MOVE, not a new component (docs/ARRANGEMENT.md §7.2): `TimeAxis`,
// `beatToX`, `xToBeat` and `zoomView` lived in `pianoroll.cpp`'s anonymous
// namespace, together with the constants that are about *time*. The piano roll
// and the arrangement need the identical mapping, and two copies of it would
// drift invisibly -- the bug being a note and a clip disagreeing about where
// beat 12 is, at some zooms, after some scrolls, with both halves looking right
// in isolation. Ctrl+wheel is the other half of the argument: `zoomView`'s
// anchoring is a feel decision with an off-by-a-clamp failure mode, and two
// copies would be two feels in one program.
//
// What deliberately did NOT move: kKeyW, kRulerH, kLaneH, kRowH, kMinFoldRows,
// kCentrePitch, PitchAxis and RowMap. Those are about a piano roll rather than
// about a timeline, and they stay in pianoroll.cpp.
//
// The functions left an anonymous namespace, so they are `inline` in namespace
// lat. Nothing else about them changed, which is what makes the move checkable:
// the roll must render pixel-identically afterwards.
