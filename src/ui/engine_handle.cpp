// THE THREE JOBS
// --------------
//   1. Own the link: reap, attach or spawn-and-attach, create the sample pool,
//      and stop a daemon we started when we go (§6, parent-of-record).
//   2. Translate. A Command carrying an RtClip full of GUI-heap pointers has to
//      become a WireClip full of pool offsets. That is what samples_/notes_
//      below are for and it is the whole of step 3.
//   3. Stand in for the engine's retirement events. `pushClip()` hands the
//      engine a fresh RtNote[] and waits for Ev::NotesRetired before freeing the
//      one it displaced; there is no engine here to send it, and the array never
//      crossed the boundary in the first place (it was COPIED into the pool). So
//      this object keeps the same per-cell "last published" table the engine
//      keeps and synthesises the event. Without it App::retiringNotes_ grows for
//      the life of the session and nothing ever comes home.

//   code did in between — easily a millisecond, i.e. several audio blocks at
//   256 frames — so a slot could be drawn Playing with activeSlot == -1. After
//   this they are one copy taken microseconds apart.
//
//   LOCALLY it does NOT make the copy itself atomic against Engine::publish().
//   There is nothing to gate on: publish() bumps no generation counter, and
//   blocksRendered is incremented at the TOP of process() while publish() runs
//   at the bottom, so a reader that saw the same blocksRendered either side of
//   its copy could still have straddled the publish for that block. engine.h is
//   frozen, so adding one is not on the table — and the remaining window is the
//   duration of this function.
//
//   REMOTELY it closes completely, and that is what step 2 bought: SharedState
//   is a seqlock as of shm v5 (odd while the daemon's mirror is writing), so the
//   copy below runs inside readCoherent() and is retried until it provably did
//   not straddle a publish. A copy that could not be proved coherent after eight
//   tries is counted in snapshotTears() and handed over anyway, because a UI
