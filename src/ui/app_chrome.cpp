// not a drawing special-cased for the camera.

// It cannot fire the control it is pointing at. A button acts on RELEASE, and
// this never releases -- so `press` holds a transport button pressed forever
// and the transport never moves. The named controls are deliberately all
// release-acting for that reason; the mode chips (AUTO, ARR, KBD, MAP) act on
// the press itself and are not addressable here.
//
// The target rect is recorded as the bar draws it and applied on the NEXT

// not exist yet when the cursor has to be placed. One frame of lag against a

//   resolveControl   an ADDRESS -> the live control it names today, with its
//                    range and its current value, in the target's own units.
//                    Answers "does this name anything" — the resolution step
//                    PARAM-ADDRESS.md puts GUI-side, and the one that has to
//                    fail soft for a mapping to a device that has been deleted.
//   applyControl     write it exactly as the widget for that control does:
//                    model, engine command, ONE undo entry per gesture,
//                    autoCapture. Nothing here reaches the engine directly.
//   drainControlInput  once a frame, from drawControlBar.
//

// outside it needs a table of which parameter runs how far.
