// EngineState — everything the UI polls off the engine, as one plain struct.
//
// docs/GUI-ON-DAEMON.md §2.1, option (c). The GUI used to read ~20 std::atomic
// members off Engine during a draw, scattered across seven translation units.
// This is the value those reads produce, sampled ONCE per frame by
// EngineHandle::poll() and read from everywhere else.
//
// Three things it buys, in the order they matter:
//
//   1. A frame is internally coherent. drawClipSlot read slotState, activeSlot,
//      pendingSlot and clipPhase as four independent relaxed loads, milliseconds
//      apart in wall-clock terms; two of them could straddle a publish and
//      disagree — a slot drawn as Playing with activeSlot == -1. One sample
//      cannot.
//   2. It is the seam the daemon needs. When the state comes off
//      ipc::SharedState instead of off Engine, only poll() changes; not one draw
//      function does.
//   3. It makes the views testable with no engine, no audio device and no
//      daemon: fill one of these in and draw.
//
// PURE DATA. No atomics, no Engine, no ipc — that is the whole point, and the
// one thing not to "improve" here. It is also why the return count is written
// out below instead of included from audio/engine.h.
