// NxTakt IPC — POSIX shared memory transport for the engine/GUI process split.
//
// This header is the wire layer and nothing else: it knows how to hand a block
// of memory to two processes and how to move POD messages across it in one
// direction without locks. It knows nothing about clips, tracks or plugins.
// docs/PROCESS-SPLIT.md describes what gets carried over it.
//
// Three pieces:
//
//   ShmRegion     shm_open + mmap with a validated header. One process is the
//                 creator (sizes the region, initialises it, owns the unlink),
//                 every other process is an attacher (read/write, never
//                 unlinks).
//   ShmSpscRing   the same contract as lat::Ring (src/core/ring.h) but the
//                 buffer and both indices live inside a ShmRegion, so producer
//                 and consumer can be in different processes.
//   SharedStateT  the polled scalar block — the cross-process form of the
//                 std::atomic members the GUI reads off Engine every frame.
//
// Header-only on purpose. The engine daemon, the GUI and the tests all want
// this and none of them should have to agree on a link order to get it; it
// also keeps src/ipc out of the app's `find src -name '*.cpp'` build.
//
// Everything here is Linux-specific (shm_open, /proc for liveness). That is
// fine: NxTakt is a native Linux DAW. The Windows port in backend_win32.cpp
// would need a CreateFileMapping twin, not a portability shim here.

// the meaning of a field. A mismatched attacher must fail rather than
// misinterpret; that is the whole point of the field.
//
//   v2 — SharedStateT gained recState[]/recSlotIdx[] so the block mirrors
//        Engine's published atomics exactly (wave 2, the engine daemon).
//   v3 — SharedStateT gained arrOverride and journalDropped (wave 8g, the
//        arrangement across the boundary: ARRANGEMENT.md §9.1). The block still
//        mirrors Engine's published atomics exactly, which is the rule that
//        decides what belongs here — and both of those are now among them.
//   v4 — SharedStateT gained returnMeterL/R[] and latencyFrames (wave 9 step 0,
//        docs/GUI-ON-DAEMON.md §1.2/§5). Both landed on Engine in wave 6 (the
//        return buses, plugin delay compensation) after this block was written
//        in wave 1, so they were the two published atomics the GUI reads every
//        frame that the wire could not carry — the first concrete regression a
//        daemon-backed GUI would have shipped with. Same rule as v3: they are
//        Engine's own published atomics, so they belong here.
//   v5 — no field moved: `generation` changed MEANING (wave 9 step 2). It was a
//        liveness counter bumped once, last, per publish; it is now a seqlock
//        sequence bumped twice — odd while a publish is in flight, even when the
//        block is quiescent — so a reader can take a genuinely coherent
//        multi-field snapshot. A v4 writer bumps by one and would leave the
//        parity wrong half the time, which a v5 reader would read as "a publish
//        is permanently in flight". That is exactly the disagreement a version
//        number exists to refuse, so it is refused.
//   v6 — SharedStateT gained posBar/posBeat/posSixteenth and posSigNum/posSigDen
//        (wave 9, the time-signature transport readout). Engine's own published
//        atomics again, and the same rule as v3/v4 decides it: this block mirrors
//        what Engine publishes, and it publishes these. The alternative — a
//        client deriving bars from `beat` and its own copy of the signature map —
//        is wrong precisely when a map was REFUSED, which is the one case where

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// A POSIX shm object outlives every process that mapped it; only shm_unlink
// removes the name. So the discipline is:
//
//   * the creator unlinks in close()/its destructor. After shm_unlink the name
//     is gone but existing mappings keep working, so an attacher mid-session is
//     not yanked out from under — it just cannot be re-attached to. That is
//     exactly the semantics we want for "engine is going away".
//   * attachers never unlink. Two attachers racing to unlink would let a third
//     process create a *different* region under the same name while the second
//     still thinks it is talking to the first.
//   * if the creator dies without unlinking (SIGKILL, segfault, OOM) the region
//     is orphaned and /dev/shm keeps the pages alive forever. The next creator
//     hits EEXIST. It must not blindly unlink — a live engine may legitimately
//     own that name — so it asks whether the recorded creator is still alive.
//
// Liveness is pid + start-time, never pid alone: pids are recycled, and
// "unlink the region because pid 4711 is gone" is catastrophic if 4711 is now
// somebody else's engine. If /proc is unreadable we deliberately conclude
// "alive" and refuse to reclaim, because leaking a region is survivable and
// stealing a live one is not.

//
// Same contract as lat::Ring: one producer, one consumer, no blocking, no
// allocation, capacity N-1 (one slot is burned so full and empty are
// distinguishable). The differences are all consequences of living in shared
// memory:
//
//   * no default member initialisers and no constructor, so a mapped region can
//     be adopted by an attacher without running anything;
//   * T must be trivially copyable and pointer-free — an address is meaningless
//     in the peer's address space (see docs/PROCESS-SPLIT.md on the two places
//     the current protocol smuggles pointers);
//   * indices are masked on load. In-process we trust the peer; across a
//     process boundary a crashed or wild peer can leave an out-of-range index
//     in shared memory, and masking turns "read past the end of the mapping"
//     into "read the wrong slot". Costs one AND per operation.
//
// WHY THERE IS NO DOORBELL
// ------------------------
// No eventfd, no futex, no signal. The architecture being split is already
// poll-based on both ends: the GUI drains events and reads the atomics block
// once per rendered frame, and the engine drains commands once per audio block
// at the top of process(). Neither side ever waits on the other, so a wakeup
// primitive would add a syscall per message and change nothing about latency —
// worst case a command sits for one audio block, exactly as it does today.
// Adding a doorbell would also drag a blocking wait into the audio callback,
// which is the one thing that must never happen.
//
// The future case is a low-power idle mode: GUI hidden or minimised, transport
// stopped, nothing to poll. Then a per-ring eventfd (write 1 on push into an
// empty ring, poll() on the consumer) or a futex on the write index lets the
// GUI sleep indefinitely instead of waking at frame rate. That is a strict
// addition — the flags would live in a reserved header field and both sides
// keep working if only one supports it — so it is deliberately out of scope
// here. The engine side must stay poll-only regardless.

// SharedStateT — the polled scalar block
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The cross-process form of the std::atomic members on Engine. The engine
// writes it once per block from publish(); the GUI reads it once per frame.
//
// Every field is a relaxed atomic and may still be read on its own — a meter one
// block stale beside a playhead one block fresh is indistinguishable from the
// ~11 ms of latency the display already has, and that is all most readers want.
//
// THE BLOCK IS ALSO A SEQLOCK (v5)
// --------------------------------
// What v4 could not offer is a *coherent multi-field snapshot*, and the GUI
// turns out to need one: docs/GUI-ON-DAEMON.md §2.1 draws one clip slot from
// slotState, activeSlot, pendingSlot and clipPhase together, and a copy that
// straddles a publish can show a slot Playing with activeSlot == -1.
//
// `generation` is therefore a seqlock sequence rather than a plain counter:
// **odd while a publish is in flight, even when the block is quiescent**, bumped
// twice per publish instead of once (publishBegin/publishEnd below, readCoherent
// on the reading side). Liveness is unchanged — it still advances whenever the
// writer is alive and freezes when it wedges — so every reader that only asked
// "is this number moving?" keeps working.
//
// The parity is the point, and it is why §2.1's own recipe ("read generation,
// copy, re-read, retry on change") is not sufficient by itself: against a writer
// that bumps only at the END of a publish, a reader that samples entirely
// *inside* one publish sees the same generation either side of a copy it has
// already torn. One counter bumped twice costs the writer two relaxed increments
// and two fences per publish, on a non-realtime thread, and turns the retry loop
// into an actual proof.
//
// Types are fixed-width and there is no std::atomic<bool>: bool's size is
// implementation-defined and this struct is parsed by two separately compiled
// binaries.
