// NxTakt IPC — the client side of the control region.
//
// EngineClient is what the GUI will hold instead of an Engine& once phase 4
// lands (docs/PROCESS-SPLIT.md §6): attach to a running nxtaktd, push
// commands, drain events, read the polled state block, and notice when the
// engine stops answering. It is written now, ahead of the GUI adopting it, so
// that the daemon has a real second peer in the tests rather than a bespoke
// test harness that agrees with the daemon by accident.
//
// Deliberately dependency-light: core/, audio/engine.h for the enums, and
// libc. No GUI headers, no audio libraries, nothing that needs a link order.
// A control surface, a headless test, or `nxtakt-ctl` can all include this
// and cost nothing.
//
// Threading contract, unchanged from the in-process one it replaces:
//   * pushCommand()/pushMidi() are single-producer — one thread, or your own
//     lock. (pushMidi may be a *different* single thread from pushCommand:
//     they are separate rings.)
//   * popEvent() is single-consumer.
//   * state() is racy by design and safe to read from anywhere: relaxed
//     atomics with no cross-field invariants (shm.h, SharedStateT).
//   * the sample pool and the clip table belong to the pushCommand() thread.
//     They are ordinary memory with a single writer, not rings.
//
// popEvent() is not a pure read: it feeds every event through observe() before
// handing it back, because the clip/pool protocol has bookkeeping on the
// client side (a cell acknowledgement unblocks the next write to that cell, a
// retirement echo unblocks a free). Making that automatic rather than the
// caller's duty is deliberate — a GUI that forgets to call observe() would
// deadlock its own clip edits and leak its own pool, and neither failure would
// look like a missing call.
